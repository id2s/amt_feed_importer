What does it do?
----------------

This extension provides function to import news from feeds. Currently it works only with RSS2 and Atom feeds (other standards will be implemented as far as possible). Also there isn't possibility to map custom fields and feed tags (marked as :ref:`TODO<todo>`).

It is intended for websites which have installed news extension and want to use news from external sources like RSS channels.
